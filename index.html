                <h2>Big Two Card Rankings</h2>
                <h3>Rank Order (Lowest to Highest)</h3>
                <p>In Big Two, the card rankings are different from traditional poker:</p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><strong>3 &lt; 4 &lt; 5 &lt; 6 &lt; 7 &lt; 8 &lt; 9 &lt; 10 &lt; J &lt; Q &lt; K &lt; A &lt; 2</strong></p>
                <p>Note: The 2 is the highest-ranking card, which is why the game is called "Big Two"!</p>

                <h3>Suit Order (Lowest to Highest)</h3>
                <p>When cards have the same rank, suits determine the winner:</p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><strong>Diamonds ♦ &lt; Clubs ♣ &lt; Hearts ♥ &lt; Spades ♠</strong></p>
                <p>For example, the 2 of Spades is the most powerful single card in the game.</p>

                <h2>Big Two Strategy Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Save your 2s:</strong> These are your most powerful cards - use them strategically</li>
                    <li><strong>Build strong 5-card combinations:</strong> Straights and flushes can help you offload many cards at once</li>
                    <li><strong>Watch your opponents:</strong> Track which high cards have been played</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't waste high cards early:</strong> Save them for when you need to regain control</li>
                    <li><strong>Break up pairs wisely:</strong> Sometimes it's better to keep pairs together for later rounds</li>
                </ul>
